/* THE FIRST-PLAY TUTORIAL.
 *
 * Teaches the two mechanics the game is made of — jump the rock, cut a rope to mend
 * the path — by spotlighting one thing at a time and then making the player do it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A DOM LAYER AND NOT DRAWN ON THE CANVAS. The engine never touches the DOM
 * and the HUD never touches the canvas; that separation is what keeps the renderer
 * testable. The speech box, the blur sheet and the hand are text and pictures laid over
 * the game rather than parts of it, so they live on the DOM side; every subject they
 * point at is canvas, addressed in stage coordinates and converted to percentages of the
 * stage exactly as the hand hint already does. (It used to have to point at a DOM control
 * as well — the JUMP button — which is what domSpot and .tut-lift were for. Both are gone
 * with the button: a tap anywhere jumps.)
 *
 * THE RULES IT FOLLOWS, all of which are load-bearing:
 *
 *   ONE THING AT A TIME, WITH THE STAGE TO ITSELF. An instruction that appears while
 *   the objects it describes are still moving loses: the player watches the movement.
 *   So an explaining step PAUSES the game, holds the stage alone, and only releases it
 *   when the player taps.
 *
 *   IT TEACHES BY DOING. The two steps that matter — the jump and the cut — do not
 *   advance on a tap. They unpause and wait for the player to actually perform the
 *   action, then confirm it. A tutorial that advances on taps has taught nothing.
 *
 *   IT NEVER COMPLETES THE TASK. Nothing here jumps, cuts, or moves the game on by
 *   itself.
 *
 *   IT NEVER LEAKS AN ANSWER. The block step spotlights the WHOLE row, never one
 *   option, and its wording is about ropes and blocks, never about which shape fits.
 *   The curriculum is the game's whole purpose and a tutorial that hands over the
 *   first answer costs the first phase its teaching.
 *
 *   NOTHING IS PARKED AT OPACITY 0. Every element rests visible and animates from
 *   there, so a dropped keyframe or a reduced-motion setting cannot leave the layer
 *   permanently invisible while every attribute still reads as intended.
 *
 * Shown on every run. `?tutorial=0` suppresses it, which is what the test suite
 * passes, since almost none of those tests expects a coach mark over the stage.

   single play with no way to bring it back — see the note in main.js. Nothing writes
   it now, and nothing reads it: a key left behind, still being written but no longer
   consulted, is exactly the sort of thing that gets wired back up by accident. */

     TWO KINDS OF STEP, and the difference decides everything else about them.

     A DESCRIBING step states what something is. It freezes the game, blurs everything
     except the thing it is talking about, holds long enough to be read, and then moves
     on BY ITSELF. There is no hand and nothing to tap: asking a child to confirm they
     have read a sentence is asking the wrong question, and a hand on a step with no
     action to perform teaches that the hand means nothing.

     An ASKING step wants a finger. It lets the game run, shows the hand on the control
     to use, and waits for the player to actually do it — a jump, or a cut. The veil is
     off for these, because the player has to see the scene they are acting in.

     `advance` says which kind it is: a NUMBER of seconds means describing and
     self-advancing; a string names the action to wait for. */
  get steps() {
    /* SEVEN LINES, SHORT AND ACTION-ORIENTED (the owner's script, September 2026). The
       earlier lines explained what the learner could already see ("He runs all by
       himself!", "Blocks of ice are hanging on ropes up here."). These establish Momo, his
       goal and the two controls, and get out of the way:

         1 This is Momo. He needs to find his friend.       describing, frozen, Momo lit
         2 Help Momo cross the Frozen Pass!                 describing, frozen, Momo lit
         3 Watch out!                                       describing, frozen, obstacle lit
         4 Tap to jump over obstacles.                      ASKING: frozen 1.2s to read (a tap then is armed), the box alone in the middle of the stage, no hand, waits for the jump
         5 Oh no! The path is broken.                       describing, frozen, gap lit
         6 Use the right ice piece to fix the path.         ASKING: sweep hand on the right rope, waits for the cut
         7 Perfect fit! Keep going!                         describing, game running, self-advances

       EACH LINE IS DELIVERED A SENTENCE AT A TIME (see beats): 1 arrives as "This is
       Momo." and then "He needs to find his friend.", 5 as "Oh no!" and then "The path is
       broken.", 7 as "Perfect fit!" and then "Keep going!". The text here is the whole
       line because that is what is recorded and what docs/VO-SCRIPT.md lists — the
       splitting happens on the way to the screen, so the three cannot drift apart.

       The pauses are what keep it fair: the obstacle is frozen on screen while 3 is read
       and is jumpable the moment 4 starts; the gap and the blocks are frozen while 5 is
       read. Line 4 folds the old "this is the button" and "tap it now" into one ask, so the
       time from resume to the obstacle is exactly what it was. Line 6 is the ask itself:
       the sweep hand on the rope of the answer says WHICH and HOW, the sentence says WHY. */

     *
     * Where the head actually is, read off the delivered run sheet (36 frames of

     * converted through the cell geometry the renderer uses — cell 420 x 320, baseGap 27,

     * of a leap and `feetY` carries the hop and the crouch — so the anchor tracks him
     * through movement and through a change of sheet, at any stage size, because these are
     * stage units and the stage is letterboxed as a whole.
     *
     * MEDIAN, not per-frame: his head bobs 56px across a run cycle, and a box that chased
     * it would jitter. Anchored to the middle of that bob the box holds still while the
     * tail stays on his head throughout.

           tapping hand at it. The button is gone (index.html), and so is the hand: a hand

           place for it: "Tap to jump" is an instruction about the whole screen, not a line
           Momo is saying, and a box in the middle of the sky says "anywhere" the way a box
           parked on one character cannot. The tail still leans toward him (aimX), so it is
           plain who does the jumping.

           The spot is a wide, low oval in the open sky above the ice — y 560 is under the
           rope line and above the rock's top (656) — so the box lands in the middle band of

   * text, and a block of text is the one thing a five-year-old will not read: it is a
   * paragraph in a speech bubble, which is what a worksheet looks like. A comic gives one

   * the box in turn — "This is Momo." lands, is read, pops out, and "He needs to find his
   * friend." pops in behind it. Each sentence gets its own pop, its own hug to the words
   * and its own beat, which is what makes it read as someone SPEAKING rather than as a
   * caption appearing.
   *
   * THE WORDS THEMSELVES ARE NOT REWRITTEN HERE, and that is deliberate. Every line is
   * recorded in the owner's voice-over as one take (CFG.vo.lines) and listed verbatim in
   * docs/VO-SCRIPT.md; changing a sentence in this file would silently desynchronise the
   * three and a test would rightly fail. Splitting at display time gives the shorter,
   * simpler delivery that was asked for while the script, the recording and the doc stay
   * one thing. A line that has to be genuinely shorter is shortened in the script above,
   * re-recorded, and moved in the doc — all three together.
   *
   * The sentences share the clip when there is a voice, in proportion to their length, so
   * what is on screen is what is being said at that moment.

         began about 0.3s — one or two words — behind the voice.

         So the anchor is the voice's real position when the words are written. If it has

         has not, the delay is the remaining wait. This also absorbs a resume: the reveal

   * far shorter than the cap. Measured on "This is Momo. He needs to find his friend.": a 500px

   *
   * So the lines are measured and the box is set to the widest of them. Every word is its own
   * inline-block (setWords), so `offsetTop` groups them into lines and offsetLeft/offsetWidth
   * bound each one — LAYOUT geometry, so the pop animation's transforms cannot corrupt it. A
   * narrower box can never pull a word up onto the line above, so the wrap survives the change;
   * `balance` is given one chance to re-break it and the wider result wins.
   *
   * The vertical air is balanced the same way. A line box reserves the font's descent plus
   * half-leading under the baseline and only (ascent - cap height) plus half-leading over a
   * capital, so equal padding leaves MORE space under the last line: measured 47px against
