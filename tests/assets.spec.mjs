/* Asset and sprite integrity.
 *
 * Every one of these has caught a real defect in this project at least once:
 *
 *   CUTS      a frame whose opaque pixels ran to the edge of its cell had had a
 *             trunk or a tail sliced off, and bled into its neighbour.
 *   CLUTTER   neighbouring bodies touch in the raw sheets, so slicing a cell's
 *             bounding box dragged in a paw belonging to the next frame — which
 *             showed up in game as dark fragments floating around the character.
 *   SIZE      the source sheets are not all drawn at the same scale, so a character
 *             grew by a third when it stopped running.
 *   BOB       bottom-aligning every frame glues the lowest pixel to one line and
 *             deletes the vertical bob, and the run reads as sliding.
