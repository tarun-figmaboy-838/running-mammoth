/* WHY SO MANY OF THESE TESTS PASS ?fast, AND WHY THE WAITS ARE GENEROUS.
 *
 * The game's clock is driven by animation frames, and frame() caps dt at 1/30 so a
 * slow frame cannot teleport the physics. Those two together mean GAME TIME RUNS SLOWER
 * THAN WALL CLOCK whenever the renderer cannot hold 30fps — and a headless browser
 * compositing a 1920x1080 canvas without a GPU cannot come close. Measured on this
 * machine, with rendering switched off the rAF loop runs at 60fps; with the game drawing
 * it is 9fps. So one second of game time takes about three and a half seconds of wall
 * clock, and under several parallel workers, worse.
 *
 * Every beat in the game is a fixed duration in milliseconds — the collapse is ~1.4s of
 * GAME time — so a wall-clock budget sized for a real machine measures the runner's
 * frame rate rather than the thing under test, and fails on a loaded laptop while the
 * game is working perfectly. Verified: the committed engine renders at 9.1fps here and
 * the working tree at 8.8, so this is not a regression in anything.
 *
 * Two levers, and they are not interchangeable:
 *
 *   ?fast=N   steps the simulation N times per rendered frame. Physics is IDENTICAL
 *             (see the note in engine.js frame()) — it is the same dt, applied more
 *             often — so this is the right lever for a test that only cares about
 *             geometry, state or logic. It is the wrong lever for a test that drives
 *             real pointer input, because the world also animates N times faster
 *             between reading a target position and clicking it.
 *
 *   a bigger wait
 *             the right lever for the pointer tests. It weakens nothing: these
 *             assertions are about what happens, never about how long it took. Frame
 *             rate is covered separately by the performance test.
 */

/** Load the game and wait until the world exists and the loader is gone. */
/* THE TUTORIAL IS OFF BY DEFAULT HERE, and leaving it on was a real fault rather than
 * an oversight in style: the tutorial FREEZES the game on every describing step, so
 * with it running a test that swipes a rope, pokes the character or waits to walk into
 * a rock is acting on a world that is not moving. Five tests failed exactly that way
 * — "the swipe registered as an attempt: 0", "he reacted: 0", "one collision, one
 * strike: 0" — and every one of them looked like a broken feature.
 *
 * Pass `tutorial: true` for the spec that exercises the tutorial itself.
