/* THE OPTION SHAPES: art in, geometry and a game-sized texture out.
 *
 * The hanging options are now the supplied ice blocks rather than shapes drawn in
 * canvas. That only works if the ENGINE'S GEOMETRY AND THE PICTURE ARE THE SAME THING,
 * because the geometry is what the game does everything with: it seats the block so its
 * flat side is up, swells it until that edge spans the crevasse, clips it to the hole,
 * hangs the rope from the middle of its top edge, and — the whole point of the game —
 * it is what the learner counts the sides of. A vertex list that disagreed with the
 * drawing by even a little would show up as a rope attached to thin air and a plug that
 * did not fit.
 *
 * So the ring is not written by hand. It is TRACED OFF EACH IMAGE: contour the alpha,
 * simplify until only real corners remain, drop any corner that barely turns, and
 * normalise to the trimmed box. Then it is checked against what the curriculum calls
 * that shape — 6 sides for a hexagon, concave really concave — and the build fails
 * rather than shipping a picture that teaches the wrong number.
 *
 * The texture is trimmed to its opaque bounds and written as WebP, which is what lets
 * the engine draw it with one drawImage over the ring's own bounding box.

     The painted blocks have slightly rounded, mitred corners, so there is no single

     20px off the paint (a rim floating beside the picture in game); tight enough to
     stay on the paint and it splits each rounded corner into two or three, and a
     quadrilateral traces as a hexagon with 1%-long sides.

     So the tolerance stays tight and the fragments are collapsed afterwards: while the
     shortest side is a small fraction of the longest, replace its two ends with their
     midpoint. That converges on the real corner count from either direction, and it is
     the same rule polygons.js verify() applies when it rejects a side under 16% of the
