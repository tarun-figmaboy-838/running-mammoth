/* CHARACTER SHEET SLICER — raw generated grids in, engine-ready strips out.
 *
 * The generator delivers each animation as a GRID of frames at whatever size and
 * layout it felt like: run is 5x4 in 1536x1024, jump is 7x2 in 2172x724, and the
 * frames float at different heights inside their cells. The engine wants something
 * much stricter (see docs/ANIMATION.md): one horizontal strip, N cells of exactly
 * 420x320, the character centred in its cell with its lowest pixel a shared 6px
 * above the cell bottom, and the SAME character size across every animation.
 *
 * This bridges the two, and it is layout-agnostic on purpose:
 *
 *   FINDING FRAMES.  Connected components on the alpha mask, not a grid guess. A
 *                    sheet whose rows are uneven, or whose frame count is not the
 *                    product of two neat numbers, still comes out right — and a
 *                    speck of stray matte becomes its own tiny blob and is dropped
 *                    on area rather than being cropped into a frame. That last part
 *                    is not hypothetical: one of these sheets carries 147 specks.
 *
 *   READING ORDER.   Blobs are clustered into rows by vertical overlap, then sorted
 *                    left to right within each row. A grid read column-first would
 *                    scramble a run cycle.
 *
 *   ONE SCALE FOR EVERYTHING.  The scale is computed ONCE across every sheet, from
 *                    the largest frame in the whole set, so the character cannot
 *                    change size between animations. Scaling each sheet to fit its
 *                    own cell is the obvious thing to do and it is wrong: the
 *                    knockout's frames are shorter than the run's, so it would come
 *                    out a bigger animal sitting down.
 *
 *   BASELINE.        A locomotion sheet KEEPS its vertical bob — that is the
 *                    animation, and without it the run reads as skating. So run and
 *                    jump preserve each frame's height above the row's own lowest
 *                    point, and the deepest frame in the sheet lands on the shared
 *                    footline. A held-pose sheet (skid, shake, hurt) is flattened:
 *                    every frame goes on the footline, because a pose the character
 *                    holds while standing still has no business floating, and the
 *                    learner can sit on one for minutes.

/* ISOLATE THE CHARACTER inside one frame's crop.

   Area filtering catches a stray that is its own blob. It cannot catch one that is
   JOINED to the character by a thread of half-transparent matte, and the source sheets
   have those: a hair tuft from the cell next door came through as a clump of fur lying
   on the snow beside the animal, and because the thread made it one connected region
   there was nothing to filter.

   So the crop is labelled again at a HIGHER alpha threshold, which breaks those
   threads — they are exactly the faint pixels.

   WHAT IS ERASED IS DECIDED BY DISTANCE, NOT BY SIZE. Keeping only the biggest region
   was the obvious rule and it was wrong: sweat drops, motion lines and the little
   surprise marks are all separate regions too, and it deleted 60 of them from a single
   sheet — which is the character arriving with bits of its own performance missing. A
   fragment that bled in from the cell next door is FAR from the body; a sweat drop is
   right beside the head. So a region survives unless it sits clear of the body's own
   bounding box by more than a small margin. */
/* THE SLACK IS PER SHEET, because "decoration" is not one size.
 *
 * 14px is right for a sweat bead beside the head. It is completely wrong for the
 * knockout, whose stars ORBIT the character several body-widths out — every one of them
 * sits clear of the body's box, so all of them were erased: 485 dropped by the area
 * filter and 160 more by this function, which is the whole point of the animation
 * deleted. The frames came out as a mammoth sitting down with nothing to explain why.
 *
 * So a sheet can widen the slack, and can grow the crop box it is measured in — the
 * box comes from the BODY blob, so stars outside it are cropped away before this
 * function ever sees them. Both default to the old behaviour. */

     A frame box comes from the BODY blob, so the knockout art has decoration that
     falls outside it: a ring of stars orbiting several body-widths out. Widening the
     box does capture them, and it was tried — but every extent below is taken across
     ALL sheets to pick ONE scale, precisely so the character cannot change size
     between animations. A padded box immediately becomes the largest frame in the
     set, so K collapses and the character comes out visibly smaller in the run, the
     jump and the skid too. Measured: the body went from 74..303px wide to 107..250,
     and baseGap from 25 to 76.

     Keeping the outer ring therefore costs either a smaller character everywhere or
     a larger cell for everyone. Neither is worth it: the pose already reads as a
     knockout without them — it lands sitting down, dazed, with spiral eyes and the
     inner stars, which sit close enough to survive the crop. `near` below is what
